      "description": "<p>Hi. I'm Amie!<p><p>My initial career upon entering the professional world was as an exercise physiologist. While I was running stress tests in a cardiology facility during the day, I was learning to code at night. I fell in love with it and decided to switch paths to become a front end web developer. I did some freelancing and worked at a digital marketing agency before deciding to further my coding education. In July I completed the Ruby on Rails Engineering program at The Iron Yard, and while I enjoyed learning about the server side, my heart still lies in the front end. Feel free to look around and <a href=\"#contact\">contact me</a> with any comments or questions!</p>"
