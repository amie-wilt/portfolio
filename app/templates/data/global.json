By day I administered stress tests in a cardiology facility and I learned to code at night. I fell in love with coding and switched paths to become a front end web developer. I started with freelancing, got a job at a digital marketing agency, and in May, enrolled in the Ruby on Rails Engineering program at The Iron Yard. While I enjoyed learning about server side technology, my heart still lies in the front end.</p>"
